Assignment: Create an AI-powered Python tutor designed to help children learn basic Python coding. This assignment is intended to assess your front-end development, API integration, design, and prompting skills.

Requirements:
- User Experience (UX): Develop a clear, engaging, and child-friendly interface.
- You may use any AI chat APIs (e.g., OpenAI, Sonet, Gemini). Most offer free sandbox usage. Alternatively, you can host your own model (e.g., DeepSeek or any local model). Mention it in your submission.
- Bonus: Include 1-2 additional features that enhance a child’s learning experience. Examples: Customizable AI tutor characters based on the child’s interests or Interactive homework assignments at the end of lessons.
- On the home page, include a brief (1-2 paragraph) description of the application. Highlight its purpose, unique features, and your design approach.
- Provide a way to configure your own API key in the application, in case your key runs out of quota during the evaluation process.
